                <p style="font-size:1vw;">Being elected the school's team leader of the First Tech Challenge team as well as juggling my role as the head software engineer, I demonstrated to other team members the necessity of time management. Having to liaise with the Head Teacher and company CEO for funding together with programming the robot with a simple block-based visual language it was vital that I was on top of everything. 
                    This in turn led us to achieve being one of the Top 10 teams in the regional competition and successfully qualifying for the National tournament at the Copper Box Arena which sadly didn't take place due to coronavirus.

                <h3 style="font-size:1.6vw;">Nuffield Research Project</h3>
                <p style="font-size:1vw;">During the summer of 2020, I undertook a personalised project to find misidentified M-dwarfs in the GAIA survey. I was lucky enough to have Mark Gallaway as my project mentor who is an Astrophysics professor at the University of Hertfordshire Bayfordbury Observatory. I first had to filter the dataset of stars and then cross-match them with known surveys such as the Lepine surveys. Then using a JavaScript-oriented software for star plotting called TopCat, I plotted the absolute magnitude against the colour filter of the stars and compared the two distributions. 
                    The overlap between them showed the newly identified M-dwarfs which I was able to write a report about

                <p style="font-size:1vw;">Was aided by various technicians/professors at Imperial to carry out a project of my liking. I was able to produce a small scale ‘Maglev’ train using CAD and electromagnets.

                <p style="font-size:1vw;">Recently joined the QMUL Formula Student society as part of the EV research team. The team is aiming to submit a concept class of the previous year’s adapted ICE model to integrate an EV powertrain to compete with.
