                <h3 style="font-size:1.6vw;">Work Experience 10x Banking, London</h3>
                <p style="font-size:1vw;">
                    Given the opportunity to work alongside the Head Software Engineer, I learned the importance of having an agile approach to programming rather than using a waterfall method in which the small aspects of the program are first planned out, programmed, and thoroughly tested - instead of trying to code everything all at once.
                    Towards the end of my time there collaborated with other students to customise a product to meet user specifications, improving customer experience as well as guiding the team in planning, implementation, and execution of the presentation to the company CEO.

                <p style="font-size:1vw;">Displayed good initiative and adaptability by assessing each students requirements to help them not just complete tasks but understanding the content also.Developed excellent time management skills by conveying the knowledge in a short amount of time which had to be concise and easy to understandAllowed myself to be flexible and help out students after session hours.

                <h3 style="font-size:1.6vw;">Maths mentor for youngers students</h3>
                <p style="font-size:1vw;">Aided year 9 students to the lead up to their exams by helping them with the more difficult maths questions.
                    I had to be open-minded and non-judgmental to recognise what the students needed to improve on.
                    Also had to be energetic and positive to keep the mentee's attention as well motivate them when they got distracted.

                <h3 style="font-size:1.6vw;">Uber Eats delivery driver, London</h3>
                <p style="font-size:1vw;">Being a keen cyclist, I decided to become an Uber delivery driver and work under a zero hour contract. 
                    This has taught me the necessity of time-management as I was forced to allocate time for my studies and work.
                    I quickly learnt the importance of good customer service and communication skills as I was providing the customers with more than just their food â€“ I was providing a service.
                    Being more engaging, enthusiastic and cooperative towards the customer in turn helped me achieve a higher satisfaction record per delivery.
